LightBox Editor
===============

This is an archive of the simple data file editor for my LightBox project, an
8x8 array of MaceTech ShiftBrites that either displays a color plasma (with no
data file) or a series of frames from an SD card.

Also included are some of the testing scripts that I used, as well as scripts
that I used to programmatically build frames.
